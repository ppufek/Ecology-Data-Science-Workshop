Introduction to R programming language & RStudio 

## 1. Step - Setting the working directory

Set working directory through the RStudio dashboard:

1. Find the folder where your data is located :) 

For instance, when downloaded this folder from 
[Ecology Data Science Workshop](https://github.com/ppufek/Ecology-Data-Science-Workshop), **day1** folder contains:
- the file with the data - *winequalityN.csv* 
- the initial R script - *test.R*

![Go to directory](https://raw.github.com/ppufek/Ecology-Data-Science-Workshop/main/screenshots-set-working-directory/setWorkDir1.PNG)

2. Set working directory (**FOLDER**) where your data and your script is located

![Set working directory](https://raw.github.com/ppufek/Ecology-Data-Science-Workshop/main/screenshots-set-working-directory/setWorkDir2.PNG)

OR

Tell computer through R code (built-in function *setwd()*) to set the working directory, for instance:

```bash
setwd("C:/Users/Paula/Desktop/Ecology-Data-Science-Workshop/day1")
```
